# Active Context - Current Work Status

## What I'm Working On Now
Starting the LLM Scraper Tracker project from scratch. Currently initializing the Memory Bank and preparing to implement the full system.

## Current Phase
**Phase 1: Project Setup & Memory Bank Initialization**
- ‚úÖ Created productContext.md
- üîÑ Creating remaining memory bank files
- ‚è≥ Project structure setup
- ‚è≥ Package.json and dependencies
- ‚è≥ Database schema setup

## Recent Changes
- Just started the project
- Created initial Memory Bank structure
- Received comprehensive project requirements

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Complete Memory Bank file creation (systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md)
2. Create project structure with all directories
3. Set up package.json with required dependencies
4. Create database schema for Supabase
5. Implement core detection logic
6. Build Express.js application
7. Create dashboard frontend
8. Set up testing framework

## Current Task Details
Building a comprehensive LLM scraper tracking system with:
- Node.js/Express backend
- Supabase PostgreSQL database
- Real-time analytics dashboard
- Webhook integration for external tracking
- Detection of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity scrapers

## Blockers/Issues
None currently - just starting implementation

## Key Decisions Made
- Using Supabase for database (PostgreSQL)
- Express.js for backend API
- Simple HTML/CSS/JS for dashboard (no complex frontend framework)
- Railway for hosting
- IP geolocation via ipapi.co
