# Progress Tracking

## What Works
✅ **Memory Bank System**: All documentation files created and organized

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Current)
- ⏳ Project structure creation
- ⏳ Package.json with dependencies
- ⏳ Environment configuration files
- ⏳ Database schema setup

### Phase 2: Core Backend (Next)
- ⏳ Supabase database configuration
- ⏳ LLM detection signatures configuration
- ⏳ IP analysis service
- ⏳ Detection engine logic
- ⏳ Activity logging service
- ⏳ Express.js application setup

### Phase 3: API & Middleware (After Backend)
- ⏳ Tracking middleware implementation
- ⏳ API routes for analytics
- ⏳ Webhook endpoints
- ⏳ Dashboard routes

### Phase 4: Frontend Dashboard (After API)
- ⏳ Dashboard HTML structure
- ⏳ Dashboard CSS styling
- ⏳ Dashboard JavaScript functionality
- ⏳ Chart.js integration

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Final)
- ⏳ Unit tests for detection logic
- ⏳ Integration tests for API
- ⏳ Manual testing with various User-Agents
- ⏳ Railway deployment configuration
- ⏳ Environment variables setup

## Current Blockers
None - ready to proceed with implementation

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Create complete project directory structure
2. Initialize package.json with all dependencies
3. Create environment configuration files
4. Set up database schema SQL file
5. Begin implementing core detection logic

## Key Milestones Ahead
- **Milestone 1**: Basic project structure and dependencies (Today)
- **Milestone 2**: Core detection engine working (Next session)
- **Milestone 3**: API endpoints functional (Following session)
- **Milestone 4**: Dashboard displaying data (Final session)
- **Milestone 5**: Full system deployed and tested (Deployment)

## Technical Debt
None yet - starting fresh

## Performance Metrics to Track
- Detection accuracy rate
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Dashboard load times
- Memory usage patterns

## Quality Assurance Checklist
