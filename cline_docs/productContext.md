# LLM Scraper Tracker - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The LLM Scraper Tracker is designed to monitor and analyze when major LLM companies (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Perplexity) scrape the Synapticlabs.ai website. This provides valuable insights into:
- Which AI companies are accessing our content
- What pages they find most valuable
- How effectively we're guiding them to important content
- Patterns in their scraping behavior

## Problems It Solves
1. **Visibility Gap**: Currently no way to know when LLM companies scrape our website
2. **Content Strategy**: No data on which pages are most valuable to AI training
3. **Guided Navigation**: No way to measure if we're successfully directing scrapers to key content
4. **Competitive Intelligence**: Understanding which competitors might be getting more AI attention

## How It Should Work
1. **Detection**: Automatically identify LLM company scrapers via User-Agent strings, IP ranges, and ASN analysis
2. **Logging**: Store all scraping activity with detailed metadata (IP, location, pages, timing)
3. **Analytics**: Provide real-time dashboard showing scraping patterns and trends
4. **Guidance**: Track effectiveness of guided paths to important content
5. **Integration**: Webhook system for external website integration
